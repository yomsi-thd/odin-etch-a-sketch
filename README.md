# Etch a Sketch

This is a website that's inspired from the real life [Etch-a-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch);

The webpage starts with a 16x16 grid of squares.
Upon hovering by a mouse on these squares, it's background changes to a random color.
If the mouse repeatedly hover upon these squares, their colors become increasingly darker.
By the 10th hover, the background color of the square will be at its darkest and it won't get any darker.

The webpage allows a custom grid up to (100x100). 
Upon generating a custom grid, the previous grid is removed and a new custom grid is made with the same functionalities.
